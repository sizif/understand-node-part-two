Lecture 27: Exports vs. module exports

note: in /l27, greet.js

When our code is run through node, it's wrapped in a 
function expression, "almost an iife".

The require function returns module.exports. It's returning
the property on the module object.

However, exports does not work for all the module patterns
shown previously.
